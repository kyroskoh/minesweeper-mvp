## üß™ Testing

Comprehensive test suite with 60+ tests covering:

- **Unit Tests**: Game engine logic (Board, Game, Timer)
- **Integration Tests**: React context and state management
- **Coverage**: >95% code coverage on core game logic
- **Mocking**: Date.now() mocking for consistent timer tests

```bash
# Run specific test suites
npm test Board.test.ts      # Board logic tests
npm test Game.test.ts       # Game management tests
npm test Timer.test.ts      # Timing system tests
npm test GameContext        # React context tests
```

## üì± Mobile Controls

### Touch-Friendly Interface
The game includes multiple ways to interact on mobile devices:

- **Reveal Mode** (üîç): Default mode - tap cells to reveal them
- **Place Flags Mode** (üö©): Toggle mode - tap cells to flag/unflag them
- **Long Press**: Hold down on any cell for 500ms to place a flag, regardless of mode
- **Visual Indicators**: Cells show orange ring highlights in flag placement mode
- **Responsive Design**: Button size and position optimized for different screen sizes

### Mobile Usage
1. **Tap the toggle button** to switch between reveal and flag placement modes
2. **In Reveal Mode**: Tap cells to reveal them (normal gameplay)
3. **In Flag Placement Mode**: Tap cells to place/remove flags
4. **Long Press**: Hold on any cell to quickly place a flag without switching modes
5. **Visual Feedback**: Active mode is clearly indicated with colors and icons

## üèÜ High Score System

### Features
- **Separate Leaderboards**: Individual top 10 lists for Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert difficulties
- **Persistent Storage**: High scores saved to localStorage
- **Player Recognition**: Enter your name when achieving a high score
- **Time-based Ranking**: Sorted by fastest completion time
- **Date Tracking**: Records when each high score was achieved

### How It Works
1. Win a game to check if your time qualifies for the high score list
2. If you achieve a high score, enter your name in the prompt
3. View the high score lists anytime by clicking the "High Scores" button
4. Navigate between difficulty levels using the tabs in the high score modal

## üéØ Game Rules

### How to Play
1. **Left-click** any cell to reveal it (or tap in reveal mode on mobile)
2. **Right-click** to flag/unflag suspected mines (or use flag placement mode on mobile)
3. **Long press** on any cell to quickly place a flag (mobile & desktop)
4. **Numbers** show how many mines are adjacent to that cell
5. **Objective**: Reveal all non-mine cells without clicking on any mines
6. **Timer** starts on your first move and automatically resumes if paused

### Number Color System
- **1**: Blue - Easiest to spot, usually safe areas
- **2**: Green - Common in mid-game areas
- **3**: Red - Moderate complexity
- **4**: Purple - Higher complexity areas
- **5**: Brown - Dense mine areas
- **6**: Pink - Very dense areas (rare)
- **7**: Black - Extremely dense (very rare)
- **8**: Gray - Maximum density (extremely rare)

4. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
5. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
6. Push and create a Pull Request

## üöë Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

If you encounter build errors, try the following:

```bash
# Clear Next.js cache and node_modules
rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

**Common Issues:**
- **"Cannot find module 'critters'"**: Fixed by installing the `critters` dependency
- **Experimental features causing build failures**: The `optimizeCss` experimental feature has been disabled for stability
- **TypeScript compilation errors**: Ensure all imports are correctly typed and files exist
- **Docker build fails with "Cannot find module '@/...'"**: The `.dockerignore` file was excluding `tsconfig.json`, preventing TypeScript path mapping resolution in Docker builds. Fixed by allowing `tsconfig.json` in Docker context.

### Docker Issues

If Docker builds fail with module resolution errors:

```bash
# Ensure these files are NOT excluded in .dockerignore:
# tsconfig.json       # Required for TypeScript path mapping
# next.config.ts      # Required for Next.js configuration
# src/                # Required for source code

# Rebuild without cache if needed
docker build --no-cache -t minesweeper-mvp .

# Check if container runs properly
docker run -p 3001:3001 minesweeper-mvp
```

**Path Mapping Requirements:**
- `tsconfig.json` must include `"@/*": ["./src/*"]` in paths
- `next.config.ts` must include webpack alias configuration
- Both files must be available in the Docker build context
